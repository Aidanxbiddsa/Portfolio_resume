            I am an aspiring Software Engineer Studying at James Madison University.
            My curiosity for everything technological brought me to realize my passion for coding and exploring the web.

            What brought me here

        <p>
            Coding was a foreign concept to me until highschool. I started small learning about python
            and learned quickly I had a knack for logic and problem solving using an online language. A interest soon turned
            into an obssesion to know more molding the path I currently am taking. My curiosity helps
            me focus and get work done not because im forced but because I want to solve problems.
        </p>

            Enough with the boring background and more about me as a person. I have a deep love for music and even went
            to the trouble of making music with my friend. Another hobby of mine is video games, me and many
            other code frenzy people have even attempted to make and execute our own game from scratch. Through this
            process I learned basic C sharp. This game was not completed but none the less was a great
            experience to touch upon an actual game making process.
